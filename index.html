    <h1>Reasons to Pursue Coding</h1>
    <h3>Why I chose to apply for this course.</h3>

    <p>These reasons are specific to me and my current situation, and may not apply to everyone.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>A career in web design or software development will provide a living wage.</li>
        <li>As a soon-to-be-single parent, project-based employment may offer a flexible schedule that allows me to be more present for my children, and adaptable to their schedule.</li>
        <li>As an industry, tech seems to offer more long-term stability than retail management, which has been my career to this point.</li>
    </ul>
